# multi-rewards
A modified version of the [Synthetix](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix) staking rewards contract, allowing for multiple rewards tokens. Designed for use with [Curve.fi](https://github.com/curvefi) liquidity gauges.

## Overview

The [`MultiRewards`](contracts/MultiRewards.sol) contract in this repository enables distribution of multiple reward tokens for staked users. It is a flattened and modified version of the SNX [staking rewards](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/master/contracts/StakingRewards.sol) contract.

## How it Works

As an example, assume we desire users to stake an ERC20 Token `Base Token` ($BASE). As a reward for staking their token, we may wish to offer users multiple different tokens. For the sake of this example, we'll assume we have two different amount of governance tokens, `Reward Token 1` ($ONE) and `Reward Token 2` ($TWO), which we want to release over different schedules.

 * We begin by deploying the `MultiReward` contract with a link to $BASE as our staking token.
 * For both token $ONE and $TWO the contract's _Owner_ calls `addReward`
    * When calling `addReward`, _Owner_ also specifies the duration of the reward period (in seconds)
    * The `addReward` function also authorizes a _Distributor_ to further manage the reward token.
 * To begin the reward period, _Distributor_ will call `notifyRewardAmount`, which transfers the specified amount of reward tokens from their address to the contract and begins the reward cycle.
 * Users can stake the $BASE token by calling `stake`, and will then accrue $ONE and $TWO throughout the duration of the rewards period.
 * Users can claim their rewards at any time by calling `getReward`.
 * Users can also withdraw their $BASE token at any point by calling `withdraw`. At this point they can still claim any accumulated unclaimed $ONE and $TWO rewards through the `getReward` endpoint but will not longer accrue rewards.

### Considerations

Keep the following in mind when using the `MultiReward` contract:

 * The duration and amounts of $ONE and $TWO may be different, and the contract will support any number of additional tokens you may wish to provide.
 * The _Distributor_ may update the duration of the reward schedule by calling `setRewardsDuration` only after the active reward cycle has completed.
 * The _Owner_ may assign a new _Distributor_ to a reward token at any time.
 * Calling `exit` combines both `getReward` and `withdraw` in one endpoint.
 * While the rewards period is active, the contract will automatically update all reward balances anytime most mutative functions are called (`stake`, `withdraw`, `exit`, `getReward`, or `notifyRewardAmount`)
 * The _Owner_ may call `recoverERC20` to transfer reward tokens, but not the staking token. Claiming rewards may fail if this function drains the balance.
 * In order to transfer ERC20 tokens to the contract, you must first call the `approve` function on the token's contract and authorize `MultiRewards` to transfer the correct amount.
